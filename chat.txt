Duration: 3 hours
Event Type: Planned Event
Subject: Event 36130745 - EMERGENCY MAINTENANCE - bcr01.sng01 - Firmware Upgrade

=================================================================
/ Event Description /
As a result of the outages many of our customers have experienced due to router instability, Network Engineering has been working with the manufacturer and have identified an issue on a backend customer router (BCR), bcr01.sng01, which provides private connectivity for your server(s). In order to prevent an unplanned outage resulting in significant downtime, Engineers will be upgrading the firmware during an EMERGENCY maintenance window at the time referenced above.

During this maintenance, customer servers will not be reachable on the private network. Public connectivity will not be effected by this maintenance.

Private network services including the following (but not limited to) will be impacted:

- Server to server connectivity on the private network
- iSCSI
- DNS
- NAS
- eVault
- Object Storage
- PPTP / SSL / IPSEC VPN  connectivity to impacted servers
- Direct Link connectivity to impacted servers

While the maintenance window is set for 3 hours, we expect no more than 3 minutes of downtime.  Should we encounter an unexpected issue, the disruption could extend to as much as 30 minutes.  However, since we worked with the router's manufacturer on optimizing the maintenance procedure, the downtime should be no more than 3 minutes.

Again, NO downtime is expected on the public network.

If you have any problems after this time frame with regard to connectivity, or if you have any questions regarding the maintenance at any point, please open a ticket in the customer portal referencing this event ID.

We appreciate your patience during this work and welcome any feedback.

Thank you,
Network Engineering

Support Team | 15:51
as i can see you are using watchdog for backup purposes.
firstly we are you going to move to backup server? is there any problem with the main server?
please advice
Kenichi Teranishi | 15:54
> is there any problem with the main server?
no
but we want to make test in case of main failure
Support Team | 15:56
The easiest way to do it is the below.
1. Connect to MT4 Admin on the main server
2. Execute the command Switch to backup from services 
3. Connect to MT4 Admin with the ip of your backup server
4. Activate server
the same way you can move to your main server later
Kenichi Teranishi | 15:57
are you there
Support Team | 15:57
yes. i just post my comments
Kenichi Teranishi | 15:58
that is all?
Support Team | 15:58
you did not get it
Kenichi Teranishi | 15:58
i saw it
1. Connect to MT4 Admin on the main server
dont i stop mtsrv service?
Support Team | 15:59
no need
it will be stopped automatically on the main server and started on backup
Kenichi Teranishi | 16:00
so when i want to restore back to main server that is the same?
Support Team | 16:00
yes
Kenichi Teranishi | 16:01
how about watchdog?
i have do nothing with it
Support Team | 16:02
it will stopped automatically on the backup machine and started on the main
Kenichi Teranishi | 16:02
oh, greate
by the way, mt4 backup has to assign DC IP on it?
Support Team | 16:03
where? can you show me please?
Kenichi Teranishi | 16:04
you know, we are configuring that alll of connection from customers to MT4 main are not allowed. just connect to DC.
when i switch to backup server. will i do anything more ?
Support Team | 16:06
on DC did you spesify the ip of your backup server?
Also in list of MT4 Admin --> DataCenters you have the DC and the backup server with priority idle?
Kenichi Teranishi | 16:09
no
now i only have ip main server
Support Team | 16:10
add your backup server and set priority as idle
Kenichi Teranishi | 16:12
sorry, now i connect to administrator MT4 admin, i only see IP datacenter
Support Team | 16:14
its ok
add the backup server as well
priority as idle
and then send me a screensht
Kenichi Teranishi | 16:15
oh, i will do it at weekend
not now
but i think i will have to connect to administrato MT4 Backup server and add IP DC on it?
Support Team | 16:17
yes
Kenichi Teranishi | 16:18
now, you know, main server is running, so i can not connect to mt4 adminstrator on backup server
Support Team | 16:20
yes correct
Why you do not " build " a test server and you make all your tests there?
Kenichi Teranishi | 16:21
well, i dont calculate about this
Kenichi Teranishi | 16:23
If the main server is not available via the Administrator terminal, you should switch to the backup server manually.
Make sure that the main server is stopped. Check if MetaTrader Server service status is set to Disabled or the server is disabled physically. Also, switch MetaTrader Server service launch type to Manual.
Stop MetaTrader 4 WatchDog on the backup server by the Stop dialog command or by stopping the system service.
If a data center has been installed and launched on the backup server along with the WatchDog service (as an additional access point of the main server), stop it as well.
Launch the backup server: a trade server service is installed in the system when installing MetaTrader 4 WatchDog. Launch it.
Start history synchronization (the backup server may not have the history for the last 30 minutes, since WatchDog synchronizes the history only once per 30 minutes).
Start the platform update manually from the Services menu of the Administrator terminal.
these on your website
i like your way, but can you tell me, we miss anything?
Support Team | 16:26
we did not miss.

the above procedure is when the main server is not available via the MetaTrader 4 Administrator
Kenichi Teranishi | 16:28
After the main server's operability is restored, switch back to it from the backup server. Wait for a break between trading sessions (for example, on Saturday or Sunday) and take the following steps:
Stop the backup server.
Move the following files from the backup server to the main one:
*.exe files
database files: users.dat, orders.dat and daily.dat
configuration files: license.lic, access.ini, common.ini, feeders.ini, groups.ini, holidays.ini, managers.ini, plugins.ini, secgroups.ini, securities.ini, servers.ini, sync.ini, time.ini
plugins and their settings from the 'plugins' directory
history files from the 'history' folder
Launch the main server.
Launch WatchDog on the backup server.
i dont have to move files backups to main if restore?
Support Team | 16:31
no need
Kenichi Teranishi | 16:33
so you mean, i only do steps if i cant connect to MT4 main, right?
Support Team | 16:34
the above steps is when you main server is totally down and watchdog is not running to it
Kenichi Teranishi | 16:35
thank you. i will do this
thanks
